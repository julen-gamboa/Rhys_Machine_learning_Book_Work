#### Using mlr to train your first kNN model####

#We understand the problem we’re trying to solve (classifying new patients
#into one of three classes), and now we need to train the kNN algorithm to
#build a model that will solve that problem. Building a machine learning
#model with the mlr package has three main stages:
#  1 Define the task. The task consists of the data and what we want to do
#with it. In this case, the data is diabetesTib, and we want to classify
#the data with the class variable as the target variable.
#  2 Define the learner. The learner is simply the name of the algorithm
#we plan to use, along with any additional arguments the algorithm accepts.
#  3 Train the model. This stage is what it sounds like: you pass the task
#to the learner, and the learner generates a model that you can use to make
#future predictions.


###Telling mlr what we’re trying to achieve: Defining the task####

# Begin by defining our task. The components needed to define a task are
# * The data containing the predictor variables
# (variables we hope contain the information needed to make
# predictions/solve our problem)
# * The target variable we want to predict

# For supervised learning, the target variable will be categorical if
# we have a classification problem, and continuous if we have a
# regression problem.

# For unsupervised learning, we omit the target variable from our
# task definition, as we don’t have access to labeled data.

# Our target variable in this problem is to predict the patient class
# using data on glucose, insulin or steady state blood glucose level (sspg)

# The classification model uses the makeClassifTask() function.
# Regression models use the makeRegrTask() function.
# Clustering models use the makeClusterTask() function.

diabetesTask = makeClassifTask(data = diabetesTib, target = "class")

diabetesTask

####Telling mlr which algorithm to use: Defining the learner####

# The first argument to the makeLearner() function is the algorithm that
# we’re going to use to train our model. In this case, we want to use the
# kNN algorithm, so we supply "classif.knn" as the argument.

# The argument par.vals stands for parameter values, which allows us
# to specify the number of k-nearest neighbors we want the algorithm to use.

listLearners()$class

# or list by function

listLearners("classif")$class
listLearners("regr")$class
listLearners("cluster")$class

knn = makeLearner("classif.knn", par.vals = list("k" = 2))

##### Putting it all together: Training the model ######

knnModel = train(knn, diabetesTask)

##### Check how it performs #####

knnPred = predict(knnModel, newdata = diabetesTib)
knnPred

# MMCE is simply the proportion of cases classified as a class other
# than their true class. Accuracy is the opposite of this:
# the proportion of cases that were correctly classified by the model.
# You can see that the two sum to 1.00

performance(knnPred, measures = list(mmce, acc))


#### Holdout cross-validation #####

# If your test set is too small, then the estimate of performance is
# going to have high variance; but if the training set is too small,
# then the estimate of performance is going to have high bias.
# A commonly used split is to use two-thirds of the
# data for training and the remaining one-third as a test set.

holdout = makeResampleDesc(method = "Holdout", split = 2/3,
                            stratify = TRUE)

# The optional argument, stratify = TRUE asks the function to ensure
# that when it splits the data into training and test sets, it tries
# to maintain the proportion of each class of patient in each set.
# This is important in classification problems like ours, where the
# groups are very unbalanced (we have more healthy patients
# than both other groups combined) because, otherwise, we could get
# a test set with very few of one of our smaller classes.

holdoutCV = resample(learner = knn, task = diabetesTask,
                      resampling = holdout, measures = list(mmce, acc))

####Calculating a Confusion Matrix#####

calculateConfusionMatrix(holdoutCV$pred, relative = TRUE)

# The absolute confusion matrix is easier to interpret. The rows
# show the true class labels, and the columns show the predicted labels.
# The numbers represent the number of cases in every combination of
# true class and predicted class.
# Correctly classified patients are found on the diagonal of the matrix
# (where true class == predicted class).

# As the performance metrics reported by holdout CV depend so heavily
# on how much of the data we use as the training and test sets, I try
# to avoid it unless my model is very expensive to train, so I generally
# prefer k-fold CV.

####K-fild cross-validation####

# In k-fold CV, we randomly split the data into approximately equal-sized
#chunks called folds. Then we reserve one of the folds as a test set and
# use the remaining data as the training set (just like in holdout).
# We pass the test set through the model and make a record of the relevant
# performance metrics. Now, we use a different fold of the data as
# our test set and do the same thing. We continue until all the folds
# have been used once as the test set. We then get an average of the
# performance metric as an estimate of model performance.

# we can improve this a little by using repeated k-fold CV, where, after the
# previous procedure, we shuffle the data around and perform it again.
# A commonly chosen value of k for k-fold is 10. Again, this depends on
# the size of the data, among other things, but it is a reasonable
# value for many datasets.  If you have the computational power, it is
# usually preferred to use repeated k-fold CV instead of ordinary k-fold.

kFold = makeResampleDesc(method = "RepCV", folds = 10, reps = 50,
                          stratify = TRUE)

####CALCULATING A CONFUSION MATRIX for k-fold CV#####

calculateConfusionMatrix(kFoldCV$pred, relative = TRUE)


####Leave-one-out cross-validation####

# Because the test set is only a single observation, leave-one-out CV tends
# to give quite variable estimates of model performance (because the
# performance estimate of each iteration depends on correctly labeling
# that single test case). But it can give lessvariable estimates of
# model performance than k-fold when your dataset is small.

####Parameters & hyperparameters#####

# hyperparameter: a variable or option that controls how a model makes
# predictions but is not estimated from the data.
# Always use a procedure called hyperparameter tuning to automate
# the selection process (unless it is computationally prohibitive)

# The first thing we need to do is define a range of values over which mlr
# will try, when tuning k:

knnParamSpace = makeParamSet(makeDiscreteParam("k", values = 1:10))

# there are also functions to define continuous and logical hyperparameters

# Next, we define how we want mlr to search the parameter space.

gridSearch = makeTuneControlGrid()

# Next, we define how we’re going to cross-validate the tuning procedure.
# In this case, will use repeated k-fold CV

# The principle here is that for every value
# in the parameter space (integers 1 to 10), we perform repeated k-fold CV.
# For each value of k, we take the average performance measure across all
# those iterations and compare it with the average performance measures
# for all the other values of k we tried. This will hopefully give us the
# value of k that performs best:

cvForTuning = makeResampleDesc("RepCV", folds = 10, reps = 20)

tunedK = tuneParams("classif.knn", task = diabetesTask,
                     resampling = cvForTuning,
                     par.set = knnParamSpace, control = gridSearch)

tunedK$x

# Plot the tuning process
library(ggplot2)

knnTuningData = generateHyperParsEffectData(tunedK)

plotHyperParsEffect(knnTuningData, x = "k", y = "mmce.test.mean",
                    plot.type = "line") +
  theme_bw()

# Now we can train our final model, using our tuned value of k:
tunedKnn = setHyperPars(makeLearner("classif.knn"),
                           par.vals = tunedK$x)

tunedKnnModel = train(tunedKnn, diabetesTask)

#Re-run with new hyperparameter

knn = makeLearner("classif.knn", par.vals = list("k" = 7))

knnModel = train(knn, diabetesTask)

knnPred = predict(knnModel, newdata = diabetesTib)

kFold = makeResampleDesc(method = "RepCV", folds = 10, reps = 50,
                         stratify = TRUE)

kFoldCV = resample(learner = knn, task = diabetesTask,
                   resampling = kFold, measures = list(mmce, acc))

kFoldCV$aggr

calculateConfusionMatrix(kFoldCV$pred, relative = TRUE)

####Including hyperparameter tuning in cross-validation####

# This takes the form of nested CV, where an inner loop cross-validates
# different values of our hyperparameter (just as we did earlier),
# and then the winning hyperparameter value gets passed to an outer CV
# loop. In the outer CV loop, the winning hyperparameters are used for
# each fold.

# Nested CV proceeds like this:

# 1 Split the data into training and test sets (this can be done using the
# holdout, k-fold, or leave-one-out method). This division is called the
# outer loop.

# 2 The training set is used to cross-validate each value of our hyperparameter
# search space (using whatever method we decide). This is called the inner loop.

# 3 The hyperparameter that gives the best cross-validated performance from each
# inner loop is passed to the outer loop.

# 4 A model is trained on each training set of the outer loop, using the best
# hyperparameter from its inner loop. These models are used to make predictions
# on their test sets.

# 5 The average performance metrics of these models across the outer loop are
# then reported as an estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data.
